## About

Tower of Terror is a death run themed game mode for [Epoch Mod A3](https://github.com/EpochModTeam/Epoch). It features a variety of traps, obstacles and triggerable events that challenge players to be the first to reach the finish line.

It was designed as a fun and alternative custom event for the Epoch Mod 0.5 celebration. It currently uses the green mountain tower on Chernarus as a point of interest with which the level is built around.
