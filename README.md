## About

Tower of Terror is a death run themed game mode for [Epoch Mod A3](https://github.com/EpochModTeam/Epoch).  It features a range of traps, obstacles, puzzles and triggerable events that challenge players to be the first to reach the cross finish line.

It was designed as a fun and alternative custom event for the Epoch Mod 0.5 celebration and uses the green mountain radio tower on Chernarus as a point of interest with which the level is built upon.
